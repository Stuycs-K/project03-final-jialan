# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Jialan Chen
       
# Intentions:

Rock paper scissors between 2 people.
    
# Intended usage:

Type in your choice and wait for a response or until the timer runs out.
The results will return in the terminal and the points will be stored in one of the corners.
Exit the game with exit and other features by typing in the command.
  
# Technical Details:

A description of your technical design. This should include:
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project:
- allocating memory
- working with files (intend to be able to save)
- semaphores
- pipes
     
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
- working alone!
- make sure that the basic game can be played before adding other features such as
- saving game, pointer counter, etc
  
What data structures you will be using and how.
- maybe arrays, not entirely sure if any
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project.
1/7-1/10 (4 days): 
-the two programs can communicate with each other (receiving the right results)
-the basic game can be played

1/13-1/15 (3 days): 
-implementing save states using files

1/16-1/17 (2 days):
-implementing point counters and nicer ways of ending the game
-allowing for additional rounds/rematch

1/20-1/21 (2 days):
-checking for bugs and maybe making the UI prettier?
